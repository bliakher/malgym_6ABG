## Working with files - cheatsheet

#### Opening
``` python
f = open(filename, mode)
```
- **f** is a *file handler* - something to work with files
- **filename**: relative to the python program
  - if saved in same directory - just name of the file - a.py
  - saved somewhere else - whole path to file - /Users/evgeniagolubeva/Desktop/a.py
- **modes**: different options to open a file
  - "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
  - "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
  - "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
  
#### File names
```
main_directory
|--- main.py
|--- a.txt
|--- inner_directory
     |--- b.txt
    
```
- file names relative to main.py:
  - "a.txt"
  - "inner_directory/b.txt"

#### Reading
``` python
content = f.read() # reads whole file
part = f.read(10) # reads 10 chars - letters
line = f.readline() # reads 1 line

# looping through lines of file
for line in f.readlines():
  print(line)
```

#### Writing
``` python
f.write("I can write to file.")
```

#### Closing
- always close the file after using it
``` python
f.close()
```
- or use with construct - you don't have to close the file:
``` python
with open("a.txt", 'r') as f:
  f.read()
```

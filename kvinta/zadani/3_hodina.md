## Samostatná práce

### Warm up

- what is an algorithm?
- what is the difference between algorithm and implementation?
- what is time complexity?
- order these time complexities (what is the best and the worst) : n, log n, n^2

### Sorting (třídění / řazení)

- goal: sort numbers by size
- types of sorting: internal (vnitřní třídění) x external (vnější třídění)
  - internal - all numbers can fit in memory - eg. sorting arrays
  - external - sorting in files - whole content can't fit in memory
- we will be talking only about internal sorting
- sorting in place (na místě) - you don't use any additional memory - you can only switch elements between each other

### Sorting algorithms

- each of you was assigned to one sorting algorithm (below)
- your task will be to learn about the sorting algorithm
- read some articles about the algorithm, try to understand what exactly is the algorithm doing and why it sorts numbers correctly
- look at the time complexity of your algorithm
  - for all the 3 algorithms it's O(n^2)
  - do you think it can be done faster?
  - try to find out why it's O(n^2) - we will look into it together
  
- **Algorithms:**
  - Select sort (třídění výběrem) - Julča T., Nikola, Gio, Naoya, Viktor
  - Insert sort (třídění vkládáním) - Ondra, Lucka, Jirka, Max, Julča S., Jana
  - Bubble sort (bublinkové třídění) - Kryštof, Vojta H., Filip, Fedor, Michal,  Vojta T.

- I would recommend to start with czech wikipedia, then english (more details), then something else if you need
- if you have spare time you can try to implement your algorithm in python (optional)
